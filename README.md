## QIVISE: A Quantum-inspired Interactive Video Search Engine in VBS2023

This repo is the official implementation of “**QIVISE: A Quantum-inspired Interactive Video Search Engine in VBS2023**” by Weixi Song, Jiangshan He, Xinghan Li, Shiwei Feng, and Chao Liang.

We used this system to participate in the VBS2023 and won the Best Newcomer. See details in [Video Browser Showdown](https://videobrowsershowdown.org/hall-of-fame/).

## Abstract

In this paper, we present a quantum-inspired interactive video search engine (QIVISE), which will be tested in VBS2023. QIVISE aims at assisting the user in dealing with Known-Item Search and Ad-hoc Video Search tasks with high efficiency and accuracy. QIVISE is based on a text-image encoder to achieve multi-modal embedding and introduces multiple interaction possibilities, including a novel quantum-inspired interaction on paradigm, label search, and multi-modal search to refine the retrieval results via user’s interaction and feedback.
